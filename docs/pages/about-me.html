<h3>About Me</h3>

<div class="bodytext">
<p>My name is Anders Bandt and I'm a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. My main involvement on campus is with
<a href="https://making.engr.wisc.edu/">Makerspace</a> on campus. There, I am a student employee as well as president of a club called Mad Makers. You can check that club out at <a href="https://uwmadmakers.com/"
>this link</a> (you'll find the site very similiar to this one... work smarter not harder :) ).</p>

<p>Some of my interests include hydroponics, wearable technology, IoT devices, and light/audio design.</p>

<p>My other hobbies include running, cooking, and skateboarding. I have completed several marathons, and have also started to explore triathlons - most recently completing the Madison Half Ironman.</p>
