    <h2>Personal blog</h2>
    <div class="bodytext">
      <p>I am not a good writer by any means. In high school I never got good grades on papers. I feel like I'm a good speaker, so it's interesting how
        everything seems to fall apart when I try to bring those thoughts to a page</p>

      <p>But, I got a lot of thoughts! So I would like to work on documenting them down. It also a nice change of pace from the type of thinking I do when I work
        on my personal projects, which are often technical and involve building things and coding. Writing "pure" thought involves a little more self-reflection which I value.</p>

      <p>Writing (and publishing) also allows you to view any changes or constants in your thought patterns across time. In the same vein that it's fun to look at artwork you created in your kindergarten classroom,
        I think it will also be fun (and valuable) to record thoughts on life and such :)</p>

      <p>So, anyway, hope you enjoy this small blog section. We will see how it develops.</p>
