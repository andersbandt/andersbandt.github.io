<h3>Scope of work</h3>

<div class="bodytext"><p>What work is required of this project?</p></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="bodytext"><p>For my build, I used WS2812B addressable LED Strips. These are very fun LED strips to play with because each pixel is individually addresable, meaning you can control the exact RGB value for each pixel in the strip. Typical RGB strips only allow you to control the whole strip's color. To program some of the animation patterns that the helmets have, this type of LED is necessary. I cut 7 strips to the sizes I wanted, and began soldering the 5V, GND, and Data lines together for each section. This can be hard if you don't have much soldering experience, as the solder pads are pretty small. It helps to have a fine tip soldering iron and add a drop to of solder to all of the pads. I think it's necessary to do this because it helps the LED's lie flat, as without the cuts the strip would have a hard time making the 180 degree turns.</p></div>

<div class="bodytext"><p>Here is a breakdown of all the parts I ended up using in my helmet. It was a little easier for me to find a ski helmet and goggles because I already own ski gear. If you don't have a ski helmet specifically, you could try to use a bike helmet but it might take a little more effort to look nice. For goggles/visor, you could use a diffused acrylic or any plastic.</p></div>

<div class="bodytext"><p>I chose to use an Arduino Uno as my microcontroller of choice. If you have one available, the Arduino Nano would be a better choice because the Uno is pretty large for wearable projects! Better yet, the <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/products/arduino-lilypad-main-board">Arduino Lilypad</a> is a board optimized for wearable projects</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>To be mobile with the helmet, it has to be powered somehow. I chose to power my helmet with some lithium ion-batteries because I had some lying around. Originally, I wanted my whole battery/control pack to be located in one of the large earlobe type things I was planning on attaching to the helmet, but it was too large to fit without looking weird on the ski helmet. I ended up going for a waist-mounted solution, adding a belt loop to my control pack.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>I added a cheap voltage regulator chip directly onto the Arduino and a main power switch.</p></div>
<h2 id="implementation-building" class="section_heading">Implementation / Building</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Process</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>The assembly is pretty straightforward. I taped the LED strips directly behind the ski goggle lense, and ran the wire for the strips through my shirt to the control pack at my waist. One thing I did that I think helped the aesthetic of the helmet is adding some cardboard to create a visor over the goggles. I then covered it with black duct tape. You can also see in the lower left photo my chin/mouth area is black because I'm wearing a black mask, which also greatly helped the illusion of a full face helmet.</p></div>

<h3>Status and Results</h3>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<h3>Looking forward</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>There is so much that I want to improve upon this design. I created this in about 5 hours as a "last minute" costume, and am very confident that I can create a much better version given more time. The first area I would spend more time on is the helmet design, probably either 3D printing the helmet or making a mold like they do for theater props. The ski helmet was a great choice in a pinch, but from the side and back it is more obvious that I am wearing a helmet.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>The second area I would improve upon is the LED matrix inside the goggles. As you can see from the pictures, my pixel density is nowhere close to the actual Daft Punk helmets, cutting up strips and then resoldering them together is not nearly as practical as just designing a simple PCB.</p></div>
