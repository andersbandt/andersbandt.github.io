<hr />
<h3>Background</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>A ball grid array (BGA) package is a type of package that leverages a grid array of solder balls on the bottom of your IC package to make a connection to the PCB. The PCB footprint would look like a grid of exposed pads, and the device IC will have solder balls placed along the underside of the device.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>When reflowed, the solder balls will melt and collapse into the pad below. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>BGA technology is primarily used for high density devices. Often this is microcontrollers or processors that have many pics, but the technology can also be used for low-pin count devices that want to have the smallest PCB footprint possible.</p></div>
<h3>Motivations</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>I first had a need for using BGA packages when I started making small wearables. Specifically, I wanted to use an advanced IC for heart-rate sensing, the AFE4432 from Texas Instruments. I also used the BQ25120A (also from TI) in the project because the additional cost of using another BGA package was minimal. </p></div>
<h2 id="requirements" class="section_heading">Requirements</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Scope of work</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>This article will discuss the whole process of implementing BGA technology on your PCB designs, from the design to manufacture to assembly.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>Some basic knowledge of common ECAD software such as Altium or KiCAD would be nice, as we will be making footprints in the software. I made many iterations of the footprint in software before I was happy with the final product, so some experience with footprint creation would be nice.</p></div>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<h4>PCB board</h4>
<div class="bodytext"><p>It is very important that you realize manufacture of BGA boards IS NOT CHEAP! I got quotes up to the thousands of dollar range for a production run of only 5 boards.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>This price is mainly drive up through the very fine pitches and small features that are required for the PCB footprints. The devices I was designing for had pitches of 0.35mm and 0.40 mm.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>I will discuss vendor selection and ordering in more detail in [[#Challenges]].</p></div>
<h4>Tools</h4>
<div class="bodytext"><p>As far as tools for final assembly, you will need some high-quality flux and a hot air soldering station.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>I used a pretty worn down Hakko, which is still a nice soldering station but not the top of the line by any means.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p><img src="images/Pasted image 20231113193000.png" width="350"></p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p><em>A pic of the hot air soldering station I purchased off eBay. Only 115 bucks, a steal compared to the 700 retail they charge.</em></p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>An alternative and equally viable solution is to use a proper reflow oven. </p></div>
<h2 id="design" class="section_heading">Design</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sketches, Diagrams, or Mockups</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>Let's first discuss the two major pad types for PCB design. These include SMD (solder-mask defined) and NSMD (non-solder-mask defined). The difference is really in the name, the relationship between the solder mask clearance and the exposed copper pad.</p></div>
<h3>Design Approach</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>As mentioned above, all the "design" is really done in your ECAD software. Altium is a pretty top-tier development software and the capabilities show.</p></div>
<h2 id="implementation-building" class="section_heading">Implementation / Building</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Process</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>I really had to do a lot of reading to get this project going. I'm very unfamiliar with regular footprint layout, much less fine-pitch BGA layout. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>To make matters worse, this is a fairly niche topic at the small levels of detail I was dealing with. So not many easily accessible online resources. And the resources I found had conflicting opinions!</p></div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>After I got my design finalized, the hardest hurdle was finding a suitable vendor for the PCB board manufacture.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>I got some recommendations from coworkers at my company for a local company to use. They had excellent customer service, got on a design call with me to understand my requirements, and were very responsive. There was only a couple issues with them, the main one being I only wanted 5 boards (their minimum quantity). No board shop with that level of design support and customer support really wants to support a production run of only 5 boards. </p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>The eventual quote I got from them (and several other U.S. board shops was over a thousand dollars). No bueno for a personal project, no matter how motivated I was on it.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>I eventually went back to my roots with PCBWay (not a sponsor haha!). I ordered from them in college, but didn't think their manufacturing capabilities were up to snuff with what I was looking for. However, I checked their "Advanced Capabilties" section and thought that their copper to copper clearances might be able to work with me.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>The engineers had some questions and we want back and forth for a little bit, but eventually we agreed and I got it manufactured!</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p><img src="images/best_afe_bottom.jpg" width="300"></p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p><em>A nice microscope shot I took of the underside of the AFE4432 on top of the PCB location</em></p></div>
<h3>Wins</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>The actual soldering part of these chips went way better than anything I could have hoped for. I did hand-assembly of 5 boards over the course of many months, and the BGA chips were by far the chips I had the least problems with. Various QFN packages had many more botched solder jobs with either shorts or discontinuity.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>My main advice for this includes </p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><ol>
    <li>a liberal usage of flux</li>
    <ul>
      <li>this keeps the chip from flying away when you blow the hot air, as many of these are tiny</li>
      <li>keeping your air pressure low helps with this too</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>soldering until you see the package "snap" into place plus 10 seconds</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>But yeah overall whenever I had to replace one of the BGA packages I was much more enthusiastic to perform the rework compared to pretty much every other IC in the design.</p></div>
<h2 id="conclusion" class="section_heading">Conclusion</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Status and Results</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>400 dollars later for a small 45 mm x 45 mm PCB, and we had the prototypes in hand.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p><img src="images/IMG_9339.jpg" width="200"></p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p><em>top of the AFE4432, ignore the incorrect A1 position location :)</em></p></div>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>In hindsight for a hobbyist level project I don't know of these packages are worth the extra design complexity and cost. If I didn't have these packages on my board, for such a small board I could have made 5 for about 20 bucks. This would have made uprevving my design to fix first round mistakes so much easier. Instead, I was stuck with my initial design for many months as I paid so much for the samples.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>For v2 of the project in question I designed these for (sorry, top secret for now!) I actually switched over to simpler footprints. This makes parts cheaper, layout easier, and only costs me a slight increase in part footprints on my board.</p></div>
<h3>Looking forward</h3>
<div class="bodytext"><p>As PCB manufacturing technology improves, I can see the cost for producing these coming way down. I'm sure the same principles of any industry cost relationship will apply, and as they become more popular as a package type economies of scale will bring the cost down.</p></div>
<div class="bodytext"><p>Even though I will steer away from using them when I can, I realize I will encounter them again. And I'll be prepared</p></div>
